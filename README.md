### About Me

ðŸ”¬ **Background in Physics with an Interest in Computer Science**

I'm a physicist who developed an interest in computer science during my academic journey. This curiosity led me to learn programming on my own while completing my physics degree. My background gives me a unique perspective in solving problems by combining physics with computer science. I have experience with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Matlab, Javascript, and Lua, with particular attention to C and C++ for their low-level capabilities.

### Technical Skills

- **Languages**: Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Matlab, Javascript, Lua
- **Focus**: Emphasis on understanding and using low-level programming (C, C++)

### Projects

Below are some projects I've worked on. They reflect my interests and some of the areas I've explored in computer science and physics. This is not an exhaustive list but rather a snapshot of my work.

- **[poly-physx](https://github.com/ismawno/poly-physx)**: A physics engine in C++ I'm developing, focused on game physics simulations.
- **[lynx](https://github.com/ismawno/lynx)**: A Vulkan API wrapper in C++, aimed at making graphical application development more straightforward.
- **[neat](https://github.com/ismawno/neat)**: My take on implementing the NEAT genetic algorithm in C++, a project that showcases the interesting potential of evolutionary algorithms.
- **[spdsim](https://github.com/ismawno/spdsim)** (Simple Particle Dynamics Simulator): A Java project for simulating physical phenomena, combining my interest in physics with programming.
- **[cpp-kit](https://github.com/ismawno/cpp-kit)**: A set of C++ tools designed to make development more efficient, including multithreading, profiling, and logging utilities.
- **[geometry](https://github.com/ismawno/geometry)**: A repository for implementing geometry in the poly-physx engine, focusing on the math behind different shapes.
- **[rk-integrator](https://github.com/ismawno/rk-integrator)**: A project for a C++ Runge-Kutta integrator, aimed at creating accurate simulation tools.

### My Philosophy

I believe in the continuous pursuit of learning and applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems. The projects above represent just a part of my journey in blending physics with computer science, reflecting my ongoing quest for understanding and application. I value collaboration and am always open to discussing ideas and projects at the intersection of these fields.
