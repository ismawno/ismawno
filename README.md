### About Me

**My background**

I'm a physicist who developed an interest in computer science during my academic journey. This curiosity led me to learn programming on my own while completing my physics degree. My background gives me a unique perspective in solving problems by combining physics with computer science. I have experience with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Matlab, Javascript, and Lua, with particular attention to C and C++ for their low-level capabilities.

### Technical Skills

- **Languages**: Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Matlab, Javascript, Lua
- **Focus**: Emphasis on understanding and using low-level programming (C, C++)

### Projects

Below are some projects I've worked on. They reflect my interests and some of the areas I've explored in computer science and physics. This is not an exhaustive list but rather a snapshot of my work.

This first subset of projects are the ones I am currently working now and for which I am the most proud of:

- **[onyx](https://github.com/ismawno/onyx)**: A C++ application framework implemented with Vulkan and ImGui.
- **[vulkit](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit)**: A small C++ library with Vulkan setup utilities and abstractions.
- **[toolkit](https://github.com/ismawno/toolkit)**: A small C++ library with general-purpose utilities.
- **[drizzle](https://github.com/ismawno/drizzle)**: A particle-based fluid simulation implemented in C++ (mostly unfinished)

This second subset contains other projects worth mentioning that do not share the quality of the previous subset:

- **[poly-physx](https://github.com/ismawno/poly-physx)**: A physics engine in C++, focused on game physics simulations.
- **[lynx](https://github.com/ismawno/lynx)**: A Vulkan API wrapper in C++, aimed at making graphical application development more straightforward.
- **[neat](https://github.com/ismawno/neat)**: My take on implementing the NEAT genetic algorithm in C++, a project that showcases the interesting potential of evolutionary algorithms.
- **[cpp-kit](https://github.com/ismawno/cpp-kit)**: A set of C++ tools designed to make development more efficient, including multithreading, profiling, and logging utilities.
- **[geometry](https://github.com/ismawno/geometry)**: A repository for implementing geometry in the poly-physx engine, focusing on the math behind different shapes.
- **[rk-integrator](https://github.com/ismawno/rk-integrator)**: A project for a C++ Runge-Kutta integrator, aimed at creating accurate simulation tools.
- **[spdsim](https://github.com/ismawno/spdsim)** (Simple Particle Dynamics Simulator): A Java project for simulating physical phenomena, combining my interest in physics with programming.
